ARM CortexM3 PORT

This folder contains a port of the Atomthreads real time kernel for the
ARM CortexM3 processor architecture.

To Use:

1. Install the "pendSV_Handler" and "tick_Handler" implemented in the file
   "atomport_arm.asm" in your platforms interrupt vectors.
  
2. Complete the function "archTickInit()" implemented in "atomport.c" to 
   initialize your platforms timer tick interrupt. If you use the build in 
   SysTick of the CortexM3 you also have to add code here to start it.
   
3. If required, add code to acknowledge your timer hardware's interrupt in 
   the function "archTickHandler()" also implemented in "atomport.c".
   
4. During your platform initialization call the function "archTickInit()"
   exported from "atomport_private.h" to initialize the CortexM3 
   "PendSV_Handler".
   
5. After your platforms c-runtime initialization has completed, start 
   Atomthreads from your runtime's "main()" function.
